# LumaPress backend (skeleton)

This folder contains a minimal Express + Bun-compatible backend skeleton.

To run locally with Bun:

1. Install Bun (https://bun.sh/)
2. From this folder run `bun install`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update values
4. Start the server: `bun run server.ts`

The backend includes basic auth routes and Mongoose models for Users and Posts.
